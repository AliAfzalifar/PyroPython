Introduction
============

This is simple parameter identification  tool  for FDS. Pyropython is a python
library and set of command-line tools.  The motivation for creating this tool has
been to support the Fire Modeling efforts at VTT. As a consequence the tools are
best suited for identification of pyrolysis parameters for FDS.

Despite this background, the python library can in theory be used to wrap any program
into a callable python class that can be supplied to any minimization package of your choice.
